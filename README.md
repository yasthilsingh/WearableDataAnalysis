# 🧠 Wearable Data Analysis Dashboard

This project showcases my ability to extract insights from wearable fitness data using Python. It focuses on analyzing time-series data from personal Strava exports to uncover trends in physical activity intensity and training behavior over time.

This notebook demonstrates skills in **data cleaning**, **time-series analysis**, **statistical reasoning**, and **dashboard-style visual storytelling** using Python libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

## 📌 Project Highlights

✔️ **Time-Series Analysis:**  
Used rolling windows and trend plots to smooth fluctuations in heart rate and speed across sessions.

✔️ **Statistical Thinking:**  
Computed per-session average heart rate, cadence, speed, and distance to compare effort levels and session types.

✔️ **Data Cleaning & Preparation:**  
Handled non-uniform time intervals and structured the data to make it usable for multi-level groupings (e.g., by file, timestamp).

✔️ **Visual Storytelling:**  
Crafted a standalone HTML dashboard with clean layout and rich visualizations — suitable for non-technical stakeholders.

✔️ **Dashboard Export:**  
Removed all code cells and deployed a visual-only HTML report via GitHub Pages.

## 🔒 Data Privacy Notice

This project uses private fitness exports from a wearable device (Strava `.fit.gz` files). The data is **not publicly shareable**, but the methodology and structure are fully reproducible with similar time-series datasets.
